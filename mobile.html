        the mobile phone can be used to communication over long distances without wires. it works by communicating with a nearby base station which connects it to the main phone network. when moving , if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to , that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the cell . this is called a"hand off", and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to.the hand-off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell.
